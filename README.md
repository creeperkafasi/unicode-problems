## Glowstick emoji
I want a glowtick emoji to spam in my favourite vtubers' stream chat while they sing songs.
While at first this might seem like a simple and dumb idea, I am absolutely sure that if such an emoji was added it would be very popular all across the internet in no time.
Other than just being used in vtuber singing streams it could be used in general as a way of chreening someone.

Another feature I would like to see implemented about this emoji is support for differently colored glowsticks.
IIRC this falls more on the manufacturer's part as I think it counts as a combination of emojis. I think the glowstick emoji should be able to be combined with colored squares 🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪🟫⬛⬜ or colored hearts ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍.

Some examples of glowstick emojis from various vtubers membership emojis:
